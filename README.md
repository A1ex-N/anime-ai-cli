# anime-ai-cli

## This is a simple python CLI that turn images into anime by using the site https://h5.tu.qq.com/web/ai-2d/cartoon/index. The reason i created this is because the site is really poorly made.


# If you want to use it just
```
git clone https://github.com/A1ex-N/anime-ai-cli
cd anime-ai-cli
python anime.py <input> <OPTIONAL: output>
```

That's about it.
